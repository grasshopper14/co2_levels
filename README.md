Analyzing atmospheric CO2 time-series data using a growth model is available on ChemRxiv [here](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/68fde3d1aec32c656840915e).

The growth of CO2 levels has left the near-equilibrium lag phase around 1948 and now it resembles exponential phase of biological growth.

Atmospheric CO2 time series data shows dynamics of self-organization - write up available on [ChemRxiv](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/690af1a9a482cba1221eed4e)

A self-organized mechanism, similar to enzyme activity and growth, has been set in the dynamics of atmospheric CO2 levels starting from around the year 1720.
